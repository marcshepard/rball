<!-- About page - info about the ladder and rules -->
<template name="about">
    <div class="container2">
        <h1>Ladder Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Microsoft Racquetball ladder! Ladder matches are played at the <a href="http://www.proclub.com">pro club</a> as
            an alternative to the pro club ladder (which doesn't require people to actually play their matches). Although started as a
            Microsoft ladder, it currently includes many non-Microsoft people. Every two weeks or so (a bit longer during holidays), a new
            "Round" is started, peoples ranks are adjusted, and active players schedule matches with the people immediately above and below
            them (and can optionally play a bonus match with anyone near them).
        </p>

        <h1>Ladder rules</h1>
        <p>Being on the ladder is a privilege, so as a courtesy to others please make an attempt to play your matches. If you consistently miss matches, you may be dropped from the ladder. If you need to rest from the ladder temporarily due to work schedule, vacation, etc, just update your status on the settings page and update it again when you are ready to rejoin. It is an easy thing to do, and allows the others on the ladder to keep playing their matches.</p>
        <p>Matches are best of three, the first two games first to 15 (no need to win by two), with the tie breaker game first to 11 (no need to win by two). If both players agree, the tie breaker game can be played to 15. For the tie breaker, the general rule is that the person who had the most points in the game they lost gets to serve the tie breaker. If both players had the same points in their respective losses, you should lag for serve (as you do to start the first game).</p>
        <p>Schedule your matches early, and get them played. You are required to play the person immediately above you, and the person immediately below you. (Of course, number 1 only has one required match, as does the person at the bottom of the ladder.)</p>
        <p>Enter your match results in the web page - if you don't enter your result it gets recorded as a "no play" which is worse than a loss.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter W of L for a match played and won or lost</li>
            <li>
                Enter WF/LF/NP for matches not played. <b>Do NOT report a W for a match that is not played.</b>.
                Please be honest so we can track matches played.
                The point penalty for no plays is worse than a loss and affects both players, so if you can play, but your partner can't,
                feel free to take a WF.
            </li>
            <li>Enter a T for matches that have been played, but no winner was declared due to lack of time to complete the match (not due to an injury - that is a forfeit). In this case, the match goes in as a 'T', with no points awarded or lost. This is only for matches that have been scheduled, but could not be completed, as you lost the court, and couldn't schedule the completion. A tie is not for matches where neither players schedules worked out to schedule the match. In those cases, you would need to take a no play.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There also is the ability to have a bonus match. Each player is limited to one bonus match per round. That match can be against anyone on the ladder, provided both players have reported both their other match results. The winner of a bonus match will receive points, the loser will not lose any points. This should allow lower level players to challenge those higher than themselves, without the higher player being concerned about losing points to a lower opponent.</p>

        <h2>Eyewear</h2>
        <p>Each player is required to wear some sort of eye protection during match play. The member vote was to allow regular glasses, so that will stand. The main reason behind this is a few players stated their glasses were regulation, but you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell by looking. So, to not cause problems with that, standard glasses are permitted for play. If a player shows up for a match without any eye wear, the opponent has the OPTION of reporting that match as a forfeit, if he or she so chooses. That does not mean it is an automatic forfeit. The opponent can choose to play the match against the person without eyewear, but if so, no forfeit can be reported (due to lack of eye glasses).</p>

        <h2>Backwall</h2>
        <p>There no longer are any red lines on the back wall, so the only obstructions would be the vents, doors, and the seam where the glass and wall meet. If the ball hits any of them, simply call a court hinder and replay the point.</p>

        <h2 id="points">Points and rank</h2>
        <p>
            Points are used to calculate player rank at the start of each new round. They do not carry over to the next round; they are recalculated each round like so:
            <ul>
                <li>Start with 99 points</li>
                <li>Subtract previous rank (e.g., so if you were previously rank 10, you now have 89 points)</li>
                <li>Add 1.1 points for any match you won; if it was a bonus match then adjust by (rank difference)*(.1)
                    so you gain a bit more if you beat someone of higher rank and less if you beat someone of lower rank</li>
                <li>Subtract 1.1 points for any non-bonus match you played and lost; losing a bonus match doesn't subtract points</li>
                <li>Subtract 1.2 points for any required (non-bonus) match you didn't play (LF or NP)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Additional info</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or issues, please let send us an <a href="mailto:msladder@microsoft.com">email</a>.</p>
        <p>For scheduling matches, you can call the pro club or use their new <a href="http://proclub.com/Home/AthleticsFitness/Racquetball/tabid/305/Default.aspx">racquetball web site</a>.</p>

            Welcome to the MSFT ladder. As a new user, please reach out to a couple of active players to schedule some practice matches to help
            determine the right place to start out. Once you are done, send email to <a href="mailto:msladder@microsoft.com">msladder</a>
            with the results so we know where to place you the next round (yes, it's on to TODO list to let you submit the results in a
            form instead of email, but it's email for now). New players will not be activated until they have played
            some placement matches.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are an old-timer using the web site for the first time, then skip the practice matches and just shoot us an
            email so we can get you in the database. If you are alread in the DB via another account (e.g., you just added
            this account for FB login), then please include the account ID of the account you want to keep in the email; this
            account has ID={{id}}. Then we can make sure to activate this account with the right rank next round.
        </p>
        <p>After this account is activated for the first time, this page will let you toggle your future rest/active states yourself.</p>

            The web page tells these new users to email msladder with placement info; if newbies to play placement matches and email msladder
            with placement info, and if old-timers with new accounts (either first time web site users, or migrating to a new account), to email
            msladder with that info.(using web site for first time) , or just migrating accounts to FB account) to email
            msladder with that info. Admins should only approve users after we have agreed on where they will rank next round (and if they are migrating
            accounts, what account ID to keep and what to migrate from). Once approved, they can control their own rest/active status going forward. Accounts
            can also be deleted if they were created by mistake.

                The table above lists players who have specified they want to be active next round. The rank/points are computed from the last round they played (which may or may
                not be the last round). To adjust things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>If anyone is missing - have them add themselves; new players should create an account (for you to approve), existing players should go to settings and toggle their active/rest state. There is currently no admin UX to do this on behalf of a user.</li>
                <li>To adjust someones rank (e.g, new players), just type in a new points value for them and the return key - the table will update after you hit return.</li>
                <li>To force a player to rest next round, type REST in their points.</li>
                <li>To permanently delete a player, type DEL in their points.</li>
                <li>To merge accounts (e.g, if a player created a FB account to replace their name/password account), cut-paste the new account ID (typically Account=FB) into the "points" field of the old account (the one they last played, typically Account=Local).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Nothing is persisted until you click "submit"; until then you can make edits or refresh your browser to start again.
                Once you have everything how you like it, click "submit" to start the round.
                This doesn't currently auto-generate an email (will add that in Feb). To send new round email, click on the
                admin "send email" link (under current round settings), and cut-and-paste the generated round rank table (on the home page).
             </p>
            <p>
                If, after submitting to start a new round, you want to make some last minute changes - just click "generate new round..." again.
                If the current round end-date is not at least a day ahead, this will just regenerate the existing round.
                <b>Beware</b> that regenerating the existing round will wipe out any results entered for the round, so this can only be done
                safely the first day or two of the round.
