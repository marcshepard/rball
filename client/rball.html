        <h1>Ladder Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Microsoft Racquetball ladder! Ladder matches are played at the <a href="http://www.proclub.com">pro club</a> as
            an alternative to the pro club ladder (which doesn't require people to actually play their matches). Although started as a
            Microsoft ladder, it currently includes many non-Microsoft people. Every two weeks or so (a bit longer during holidays), a new
            "Round" is started, peoples ranks are adjusted, and active players schedule matches with the people immediately above and below
            them (and can optionally play a bonus match with anyone near them).
        </p>

        <h1>Ladder rules</h1>
        <p>Being on the ladder is a privilege, so as a courtesy to others please make an attempt to play your matches. If you consistently miss matches, you may be dropped from the ladder (by me). If you need to drop temporarily due to work schedule, vacation, etc, just update your status on the login page and update it again when you are reqady to rejoin. You will return you with the same number of points as you left with. It is an easy thing to do, and allows the others on the ladder to keep playing their matches.</p>
        <p>Matches are best of three, the first two games first to 15 (no need to win by two), with the tie breaker game first to 11 (no need to win by two). If both players agree, the tie breaker game can be played to 15. For the tie breaker, the general rule is that the person who had the most points in the game they lost gets to serve the tie breaker. If both players had the same points in their respective losses, you should lag for serve (as you do to start the first game).</p>
        <p>Schedule your matches early, and get them played. You are required to play the person immediately above you, and the person immediately below you. (Of course, number 1 only has one required match, as does the person at the bottom of the ladder.) You will gain 1.1 points for each match won, and you will lose 1.1 points for a match loss. Remember, there is a -1.2 point penalty for no plays. This is actually worse than a loss, so if you can play, but your partner can't, feel free to take a forfeit.</p>
        <p><b>Please do NOT report a W for a match that is not played.</b> Only report a W if you play and win the match. If the match is not played, it is either to be reported as a WF, or left as a no play. I want to know who is playing and who is not. I can’t do so if you report a W for a match not played. I’m asking for you all to be honest here and play by my rules.</p>
        <p>There also is the ability to have a bonus match. Each player is limited to one bonus match per round. That match can be against anyone on the ladder, provided both players have reported both their other match results. If anyone sends in a bonus match, and one of the two participants has not reported both required matches before I process the ladder, the bonus match will not count. Bonus matches are for those players who have scheduled both their required ladder matches. Before scheduling a bonus match with someone, you might want to check with them to make sure they'll get both their other matches in. We've had a number of cases where one person in the bonus round failed to get both matches in, causing the other player (usually the winner of the bonus match), to miss out on the points. Again, for the top and bottom players, this means after scheduling the one required match with your immediate partner. The winner of a bonus match will receive points (up to 1.1, depending upon how far apart in the ladder the two players are). The loser will not lose any points. This should allow lower level players to challenge those higher than themselves, without the higher player being concerned about losing points to a lower opponent.</p>
        <p>A clarification on the bonus point system. If a lower ranking player beats a higher ranking player, he or she will actually receive more than 1.1 points. You get 1.1 points for the win, plus 0.1 points for every spot higher on the ladder the opponent is than yourself. Also, you lose 0.1 points per ranking position if you are the higher ranked player who won. So, point wise, it doesn't really do you much good to beat up on players more than a few positions below you in the ladder. It may still be a fun match, just don't expect to get the same 1.1 points as a normal match.</p>
        <p>There have also been questions regarding the point system. Simply put, the points won/lost for each round do not directly carry over to the next round. They are simply used to calculate a position on the new ladder. The way the scoring works, is that everyone starts with a base number of points (99), and from there, you subtract your position for the current ladder. That gives you your base points. Then, you add or subtract your points for the current round. That gives you your points for this round. I then sort on those points, rank the players, and that's how it works. So, points do not carry over (nor are they cumulative between rounds).</p>
        <p>I also implemented a Tie match result. This is for matches that have been played, but no winner was declared due to lack of time to complete the match (not due to an injury - that is a forfeit). In this case, the match goes in as a 'T', with no points awarded or lost. This is only for matches that have been scheduled, but could not be completed, as you lost the court, and couldn't schedule the completion. A tie is not for matches where neither players schedules worked out to schedule the match. In those cases, you would need to take a no play.</p>
        <p>A WF or LF in the results indicate a win or loss by forfeit.</p>

        <h2>Eyewear</h2>
        <p>Each player is required to wear some sort of eye protection during match play. The member vote was to allow regular glasses, so that will stand. The main reason behind this is a few players stated their glasses were regulation, but you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell by looking. So, to not cause problems with that, standard glasses are permitted for play. If a player shows up for a match without any eye wear, the opponent has the OPTION of reporting that match as a forfeit, if he or she so chooses. That does not mean it is an automatic forfeit. The opponent can choose to play the match against the person without eyewear, but if so, no forfeit can be reported (due to lack of eye glasses).</p>

        <h2>Backwall</h2>
        <p>There no longer are any red lines on the back wall, so the only obstructions would be the vents, doors, and the seam where the glass and wall meet. If the ball hits any of them, simply call a court hinder and replay the point.</p>

        <h2>Additional info</h2>

            This is a new custom website for the MS racquetball ladder. It was built using <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>,
            and the source code is available on <a href="http://www.github.com/marcshepard/rball">github</a> for those who want to
            contribute. MSFT identity login is not yet supported (no Meteor packages for this yet), but perhaps we'll build something
            in the future. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please send us <a href="mailto:msladder@microsoft.com">email</a>.

            Welcome to the MSFT ladder. As a new user, please reach out to a couple of active players to schedule some practice matches to help
            determine the right place to start out. Once you are done, send email to <a href="mailto:msladder@microsoft.com">msladder</a>
            with the results so we know where to place you the next round (yes, it's on to TODO list to let you submit the results in a
            form instead of email, but it's email for now). New players will not be activated until they have played
            some placement matches.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are an old-timer using the web site for the first time, then skip the practice matches and just shoot us an
            email so we can get you in the database. If you are alread in the DB via another account (e.g., you just added
            this account for FB login), then please include the account ID of the account you want to keep in the email; this
            account has ID={{id}}. Then we can make sure to activate this account with the right rank next round.
        </p>
        <p>After this account is activated for the first time, this page will let you toggle your future rest/active states yourself.</p>

                The table above lists players who have specified they want to be active next round. The rank/points are computed from the last round they played (which may or may
                not be the last round). To adjust things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>To adjust someones rank (e.g, new players), just type in a new points value for them and the return key - the table will update after you hit return.</li>
                <li>To merge accounts (e.g, if a player created a FB account to replace their name/password account), cut-paste the new account ID (typically Account=FB) into the "points" field of the old account (the one they last played, typically Account=Local).</li>
                <li>To permanently delete a player, type DEL in their points.</li>
                <li>If anyone is missing - have them add themselves; new players should create an account (for you to approve), existing players should go to settings and toggle their active/rest state. There is currently no admin UX to do this on behalf of a user.</li>
                <li>There is currently no admin UX to rest a player for the next round - they have to do this themselves by going to settings.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Nothing is persisted until you click "submit"; until then you can make edits or refresh your browser to start again.
                Once you have everything how you like it, click "submit" to start the round.
                This doesn't currently auto-generate an email (will add that in Feb). To send new round email, click on the
                admin "send email" link (under current round settings), and cut-and-paste the generated round rank table (on the home page).
             </p>
            <p>
                If, after submitting to start a new round, you want to make some last minute changes - just click "generate new round..." again.
                If the current round end-date is not at least a day ahead, this will just regenerate the existing round.
                <b>Beware</b> that regenerating the existing round will wipe out any results entered for the round, so this can only be done
                safely the first day or two of the round.
